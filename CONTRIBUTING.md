# Contributing to Vex TypeScript SDK

We welcome contributions. Here's how to get started.

## Process

1. Open an issue first to discuss the change you'd like to make
2. Fork the repo and create a feature branch
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests before submitting: `npm test`
5. Open a pull request referencing the issue

## Code Style

- Follow standard TypeScript conventions
- Use strict mode (`strict: true` in tsconfig)
- No runtime dependencies — keep the bundle lean

## Tests

All new functionality should include tests. Run the full suite with:

```bash
npm test
```

## Build

```bash
npm run build
```
